# Web Development Project 3 - Flashcard2

Submitted by: Lou Salvant

This web app: This is a continuation of the previous project. Functionality was added to this project including a text box allowing the user to guess the answer before flipping the card, a previous button, and shuffle button. Also, a counter was added to keep track of user's current and longest streak.

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The user can enter their guess in a box before seeing the flipside of the card**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] A shuffle button is used to randomize the order of the cards

## Notes

I encountered problems with the positioning of the button. Also, I encountered a problem with randomizing the cards. I originally wanted to always have the first card as a starter card to intiate the game but since it was randomized, sometimes it wouldn't show. To fix this, I implemented a start button to intiate the game.
